## Adding content

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory.
Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

### Example

Create `src/content/docs/guides/my-guide.md`:

```markdown
---
title: My Guide
description: A guide for using this feature
---

# My Guide

Content goes here...
```

This will be available at `/guides/my-guide`.

## Adding components

Create Astro components in `src/components/` and use them in your markdown:

```astro
---
// src/components/MyComponent.astro
const { title } = Astro.props;
---

<div class="my-component">
  <h2>{title}</h2>
  <slot />
</div>
```

Import in markdown:

```mdx
---
title: Page with Component
---

import MyComponent from '../../components/MyComponent.astro';

<MyComponent title="Hello">
  Content here
</MyComponent>
```
